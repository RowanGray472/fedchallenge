"""
This file is used to create queries to pass into the graph_generator functions.
It passes the natural language input from the user to an LLM API (undecided
which one yet) to do this.

Because it involved LLMs, the output of this file is nondeterministic and 
prone to errors. It can be useful if you either don't know how to code or
want to save yourself some time, but either way you should make sure to 
double-check the outputted queries and graphs to make sure it didn't
hallucinate anything.
